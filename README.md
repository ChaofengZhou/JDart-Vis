# JDart-Viz
JDart-Viz is a visualization tool which lively illustrates the constraints trees generated by [JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart), a dynamic symbolic analysis tool for Java. JDart-Viz can significantly relieve the pain when analyzing the result trees JDart produces for us. The [demo page](http://chaofz.me/jdart-viz) provides a presentation to help getting the gist of this tool.

This project is a participation project of [Google Summer of Code 2016 (GSoc 2016)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) under the team [Java Pathfinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf). Here is the [description](http://chaofz.me/jdart-viz/description) of the project.


### Installation

#### 1. Install JDart

JDart-Viz is a supplimental tool for JDart so JDart should be installed.

Thanks to [Marko Dimjašević](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/) who has set up a Vagrant environment for JDart so that JDart can be installed by one command.

Checkout out JDart repository (currently the version I have been working on):

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ChaofengZhou/jdart.git
```

Make sure you have installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), a virtual development environment tool. Additionally, you need either VirtualBox or libvirt.

If Vagrant is ready, change to jdart directory and run:

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

The [JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart) repository provides thorough installation instructions. You can also check them out if you want to install it without a virtual machine.

JDart-Viz requires jpf, which JDart is based on and you have just installed, on PATH. Append export `PATH=$PATH:/path/to/jpf-core/bin` to the bash profile file depending on your operating system.

#### 2. Install Node.js & Gulp

If you have already installed node (with npm), you can skip to the next step. There are various ways to install node. Details can be found on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Install Gulp

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

#### 3. Build and link the project

Change to the project directory and run

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp build
$ npm link
```


### NPM package

JDart-Viz has been published as an NPM package. If you don't want to build the project, simply run

```sh
$ npm install --global jdart-viz
```


### Usages

Now you can run `jdart-viz` upon JPF config files as you run `jpf example.jpf` previously.

Initiate the server first

```sh
$ jdart-viz serve
```

then, navigate to the directory containing jpf config files, and run

```sh
$ jdart-viz example.jpf
```

A browser will pop up for you to enjoy the power of this visualization project.

### Development

If you want to develop more features for it, you can enter the dev mode by

```sh
$ gulp dev
```
