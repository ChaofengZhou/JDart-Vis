# JDart-Vis
JDart-Vis is a visualization tool which lively illustrates the constraint trees generated by [JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart), a dynamic symbolic analysis tool for Java. JDart-Vis can sigificantly relieve the pain when analysing the result trees JDart produces for us. The [demo page](http://chaofz.me/jdart-vis) gives a nice presentation for showing purposes.

This project is a participation project of [Google Summer of Code 2016 (GSoc 2016)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) under the team [Java Pathfinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf). 

### Getting Started

#### 1. Install Node.js

To run individual tasks, use `gulp <task> <othertask>`.

## Where do I go now?

You have an empty gulpfile and everything is installed. How do you REALLY get started? Check out the [recipes](recipes) and the [list of articles](README.md#articles) for more information.

## .src, .watch, .dest, CLI args - How do I use these things?

For API specific documentation you can check out the [documentation for that](API.md).

## Available Plugins

The gulp community is growing, with new plugins being added daily. See the [main website](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/) for a complete list.
